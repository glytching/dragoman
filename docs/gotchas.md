Although this application is functional, its primary purpose is to provide a sandbox, a place for trying out technologies. Rather than attempting to do so in the context of something simplistic (another chat application or a calculator, perhaps) this application is intended to provide sufficient depth and breath to make any experimentation meaningful and useful. 

So, unless an issue is blindingly obvious or embarrasingly daft or it interferes with the application's primary purpose then it will likely remain unfixed or even undiscovered.

Any issues which are known about and deemed fix-required are documented in the [GitHub repository's issues](https://github.com/glytching/dragoman/issues).

If you encounter a bug or something which feels like a bug then it's worth reviewing this issue list to see if it has already been captured. And, if not, please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/glytching/dragoman/issues/new).
