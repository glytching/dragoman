How Does It Work?
======

The technologies used by Dragoman are described below. These technology choices are typically hidden behind facades which (should :) allow for later substitution with little or no changes to the rest of the code base. For example:
                                                       
* Data access responsibilities are hidden behind `Dao` interfaces for which there are `Mongo` specific implementations
* HTTP client calls are hidden behind a `HttpClient` interface for which there is a `OkHttpClient` implementation
* ... etc

#### [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) 

To implement parsers for user supplied predicate and projection expressions. The parsed forms are translated into commands which can be applied to a dataset. So ...

* For a dataset which is stored in MongoDB, the parsed expressions are turned into `find` call against a `MongoClient` instance provided by MongoDB's Java client
* For a dataset which is sourced via HTTP the parsed expressions are turned into dynamic Groovy scripts and the HTTP response is passed through these Groovy scripts

#### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) 

To store local datasets. Dragoman uses [flapdoodle](https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo) to create an embedded instance of MongoDB and Dragoman uses [The Mongo Rx Java Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver-rx) to talk to this MongoDB server.

#### [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) 

To provide the application framework, including the web server.

#### [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)

To provide the UI framework. 

#### [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

For UI style goodies. 

#### [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

To provide templating for the user interface. 

#### [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) 

For dependency injection. All Guice integration is encapsulated in classes name `XXXModule`.

#### [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) 

To read remote datasets over HTTP.

#### [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) 

To transform data between serialised and non serialised representations. Dragoman expects its data sources to provide data either in the JSON format or ina format which can be easily transformed into JSON.

#### [Constretto](http://constretto.org/) 

To externalise application configuration to properties file. This file (`application.properties`) is discovered from the classpath and supports type safe property values, property value transformers and environment specific property values.
